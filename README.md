# Doom the Gungeon
**Doom the Gungeon** (name subject to change) is a total conversion mod for _DOOM_ that introduces a variety of guns, items, maps and mechanics from _Enter the Gungeon_.

# Requirements

GZDoom is required to run this mod. Sacrifices had to be made in order to \*squeeze the juice\*.

# Issues

This mod is not multiplayer compatible yet. However, it will be eventually since EtG's coop is wack.

1. TODO: _Find a way to count passive items from the right player's inventory when shooting bullets._
2. TODO: _Figure out respawning mechanics and such._
